This is yet another work in progress. More may be added when I think of things or new ways of doing what has already been done.
Baby steps before starting on more advanced graphic library.

A lot of experimenting in this code and it's a bit messy.

It can:

Draw horizontal, vertical and diagonal lines,
Draw filled and unfilled boxes.
Erase and clear screen,
Change pen colours,
Has it's own language to import files. A file is included here which you import by pressing 'y' in menu mode. It is a file that prints out some Scandinavian flags.
Change the painting symbol,
Enter text and change text background colour,
Enter 'L' for experimental random landscape,
Can draw a background grid,
When you are ready to quit (this doesn't save your work as yet) press 'z' in menu for the "I quit" screensaver. :-)
Import a .bmp file. Still in progress - damn thigs turn out to upside down. Figuring out format is a work in progress.
Import a text file - this works. Text file included here.



What it can't do yet:

Save,
Be easy to use or useful,
